      The Earth Centre began in 2009 with a simple dwelling. The challenge was to use mud architecture in the challenging climate of the gangetic plains, to build economically and to demonstrate a vocabulary of natural materials. The result was a 2 bed room dwelling, where the lower mezzanine room is the excavated earth used to manufacture mud bricks. For the project, natural systems such as filler slabs, Wood and Bamboo roofs, stack ventilation, Earth berming, Thatch roofing and in the further stages, lime and oxide flooring, Chachra and bamboo roofing and ferrocement roofing as well. The dwelling was built economically at a total cost of just 26,00,000 INR in 2014. Since then, the site has expanded to include 6 more smaller dwellings to cater to the new institution of 'Imarat Centre for Earth Architecture'.

Studio 1252 was Imarat’s response to this challenge, by attempting to convert an HIG government housing apartment into a mixed use studio cum residence. The studio is now the headquarters for Imarat Architects at Chandigarh. What was before a dark dingy space was converted into an open setting of various walls, some which allow views, others physical access. By inserting slabs at the 7 foot level circulation spaces were given greater definition, making hallway spaces seem higher. Lastly, the finishes of mud plasters with rice husk fibres, exposed bricks and wooden fitting demonstrate the timeless and resilient qualities of natural materials, creating a material vocabulary for clients of the firm.",

    description: `The Nyayapuri House was started in 2014 with the vision of making the mud house typology a possibility in the urban regions of the city. Its viability in rural settings in terms of economy and sustainability as well as its resilience to the climate were well demonstrated at the Earth Centre in Kuva Heri. But the urban dweller has needs for lower maintenance, durability and well insulated spaces in a habitat. So this house combines a structure with mud walls and concrete columns as well as brick pillars to create a hybrid system. This minimises carbon footprint and more importantly brings in mud into the foray of standard building materials.
    \n
    In a leap of experimentation, the making of this house brought in a team of talented woodworkers, producing furniture and furnishings in house. The experimentations were carried on with several other artisans such as the stone mason for the use of terrazzo and the use of a ferrocement slab over timber joists for spanning. The most liberating visual aspect, though, is the 6 foot cantilevers in heavy sloped concrete slabs supported by mud walls, breaking  the assumptions about mud as a kucca construction.`,

The program as well as the construction aim to respond to this. The masterplan is organised to create an atmosphere of a rural setting with densely clustered masses, spaced around open areas. The idea of meandering through and that of the promenade are the two movement patterns which shape its structure as well. This vision has allowed the client to build slowly and due to this slow pace, lime has been favoured with local additives such as jaggery and jackfruit to be used as mortar, replacing cement while kota stone in combination with lime becomes the damp proof course.",

      Control Z had a vision for changing the consumption of the artefact of the 21st century; the phone. Phones go in and out of fashion each year, and this results in a devastating impact on the mineral resources of earth. Their company tries to tackle this by refurbishing new, older phones. Doing so also reselling luxury phones at affordable prices. The task was to represent this vision in the architecture of their first retail store.
      \n \n
      The idea was to bring the energy of their workshops to the people. Inducing transparency in their process, would build trust to the consumer. To bring out the ideas of sustainability that power their vision, local materials with low embodied energy were introduced; lime for the walls and Kota stone for the floor. To introduce their process and story, tools from their actual labs are pinned to the walls. In this way, the tradition of a clean, minimal store that hides behind the covers is broken; what one gets is edgy raw and in a process of assembly and refinement. The architecture becomes a metaphor of their assembly line. The technophilic enthusiasm which is in the hands is spread out on the walls.

      The site is surrounded by a pine forest in the region of Barog. The local folklore of a British appointed charge for digging the railway tunnel, Colonel Barog is what gives the town its name. The tunnel and the railway station are intact as relics of that time and offer themselves as clues for how to build sensitively in such contexts. The new age ideas of treading lightly on the earth were considered as postulates for building here too, but with the average slope of 40 degrees, to perch lightly would have resulted in shadowed underbellies; signature of contemporary constructions. Cut and filling is used in the lightest means instead, using split levels and yet generating small spans. The 1.5 acre resort offers a bakehouse, tea house and bath house, in an upward trail, for the wanderer that stumbles upon it. 9 sets of rooms adjoin these facilities, scattered about the site’s landscape. The site is steep and the project celebrates the physical challenge of this condition. To hike up the mountain like a Billy Goat- is where the name draws from.
      \n
      The conditions of the site shape the imaginations of this project. Nostalgic to the typical movement patterns of cities in the Himalayan region, the project seeks to capture the spirit of a Himalayan settlement. The generosity of Chaugans that restore leisures of time, The clustered hawkers lavishing food and craft and, the snug village houses with niches and small wooden windows; all cultivate the atmospheres of Himalayan Habitats.They work with the vegetation. Facts of simple pleasure which are left behind in modern luxury resorts. A green metal bench next to a cliff, well placed, with an absence of whirring sounds of generators can work wonders. The idea is simple; to preserve what is good and to make what is missing.

      The House of Glass is an impractical dream in North Indian setting. But this project tries to make it true. To bring in its living room, a tree; something living. To make small spaces big and with a unity of small gestures, beckon a sense of surrealism. DBH was brought on when 6 columns and their foundations had already been put up, so the idea was simply to inquire about what can supplement, compliment and contrast; the end result is an inner dialogue of light filigree steel spans and typical brick and concrete masonry; the classical binary of the stereotomic and tectonic. The small plot is sliced into two symmetrical halves, and through the slice goes the promenade. Walking on it, encounters on the left and right fluctuate; the outer court with a patch of green, the inner double volume, a wall of glass on the left and the comfort couch on the right, a lamp on the left a kitchen counter reaching out on the right, a staircase to the left and further ahead a wardrobe on the right, then a bed and then a washroom and exiting it all, a backyard on top of which hangs attached to a gardened terrace, planted flowers drooping down.
      \n\n
      The client, an eccentric engineer, is also a skateboarder. The house is such a boyhood club. The house grows into a home and with time the spaces are meant to adapt. The floor above which contains a small room connected to the terrace garden also bears a study hanging out of it, ‘the cockpit’. Overlooking the larger double volume, it brings a sense of exteriority to the living space. And with the lamp post and the tree and the glass wall, it cultivates a magical surrealism. The practical intentions are to imagine  beautiful conditions of living in a small plot of 45’ by 20’. But the impractical dream is what makes this project one of the favourites on our drafting boards.

    description: `
      The idea was to create a novel prototype of what a public office could be. The freshly appointed speaker for Haryana, Mr. Harvinder Kalyan had a vision to change the way we envisioned government offices in India. The examples that generally span this architectural typology contain run down plasticised materials, dingy under-lighted spaces, and unregulated public traffic. This had to change, giving way to representation of local identity. Frugal sensibilities, natural materials and open, green environs. To set a bar, the functions were planned around a courtyard. The main circulation is through a three tier corridor, regulating pedestrian traffic. How people perceive their leaders changes their own attitudes towards materials and building traditions. Natural materials and vernacular techniques are currently being abandoned in villages for faster constructions. But this can change and therein lies the project’s biggest hope. 
      \n\n
      The blocks are planned without a single concrete column and with pitched roofs. The volumes face open courts to allow for flexibility in accommodating wider populations. The existing trees on site were not displaced in the process of this construction. Lying on the north south axis are wall articulations which offer greater support than singular straight walls and further chop down the harsh Indian sun. This reduces glare inside while filling the spaces with ample light. Despite the functional and climatic concerns, the project inquires about local living patterns with manjis in verandahs and veras in the shade of lofty trees, where village gatherings typically happened to resolve matters. Beyond the local mud plaster techniques which derive from Indian building traditions it is these mannerisms which cultivate the architecture of this project.

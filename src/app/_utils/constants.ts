      The Earth Centre began in 2009 with a simple dwelling. The challenge was to use mud architecture in the challenging climate of the gangetic plains, to build economically and to demonstrate a vocabulary of natural materials. The result was a 2 bed room dwelling, where the lower mezzanine room is the excavated earth used to manufacture mud bricks. For the project, natural systems such as filler slabs, Wood and Bamboo roofs, stack ventilation, Earth berming, Thatch roofing and in the further stages, lime and oxide flooring, Chachra and bamboo roofing and ferrocement roofing as well. The dwelling was built economically at a total cost of just 26,00,000 INR in 2014. Since then, the site has expanded to include 6 more smaller dwellings to cater to the new institution of 'Imarat Centre for Earth Architecture'.

      "The greatest act of building sustainably means not building at all. In recent years, architects have forayed into the potential of an architecture of retrofit. Studio 1252 was Imarat’s response to this challenge, by attempting to convert an HIG government housing apartment into a mixed use studio cum residence. The studio is now the headquarters for Imarat Architects at Chandigarh. What was before a dark dingy space was converted into an open setting of various walls, some which allow views, others physical access. By inserting slabs at the 7 foot level circulation spaces were given greater definition, making hallway spaces seem higher. Lastly, the finishes of mud plasters with rice husk fibres, exposed bricks and wooden fitting demonstrate the timeless and resilient qualities of natural materials, creating a material vocabulary for clients of the firm.",

    description: `The Nyayapuri House was started in 2014 with the vision of making the mud house typology a possibility in the urban regions of the city. Its viability in rural settings in terms of economy and sustainability as well as its resilience to the climate were well demonstrated at the Earth Centre in Kuva Heri. But the urban dweller has needs for lower maintenance, durability and well insulated spaces in a habitat. So this house combines a structure with mud walls and concrete columns as well as brick pillars to create a hybrid system. This minimises carbon footprint and more importantly brings in mud into the foray of standard building materials.
    \n
    In a leap of experimentation, the making of this house brought in a team of talented woodworkers, producing furniture and furnishings in house. The experimentations were carried on with several other artisans such as the stone mason for the use of terrazzo and the use of a ferrocement slab over timber joists for spanning. The most liberating visual aspect, though, is the 6 foot cantilevers in heavy sloped concrete slabs supported by mud walls, breaking  the assumptions about mud as a kucca construction.`,

The challenge of this brief is to accomplish the puritan vision of building naturally- to the level that no cement is brought to the site. The program as well as the construction aim to respond to this. The masterplan is organised to create an atmosphere of a rural setting with densely clustered masses, spaced around open areas. The idea of meandering through and that of the promenade are the two movement patterns which shape its structure as well. This vision has allowed the client to build slowly and due to this slow pace, lime has been favoured with local additives such as jaggery and jackfruit to be used as mortar, replacing cement while kota stone in combination with lime becomes the damp proof course.",

This vision is worked towards refinement into the section and the general plan and onwards until the detailed wall section itself is resolved. The elements of the monastic life, its rituals guide aspects of the design, each activity is granted circular walls while the service spaces are rectilinear. A simpler design by a different agency was ultimately procured for a temporary shelter for the monks.",
